      Veality is an app where users can browse and purchase virtual reality
      experiences at a Veality location near them. Main purpose of the app, was
      to attract the senior adult users who are the fastest-growing group of
      smartphone users. By simplifying the functions, it would allow them to
      purchase them as gifts for their friends and family members without any
      hassles.</h2>
    <h3>
      Role: I worked alone on this project. I first set out to research my users and
      the competition</h3>
    <h2>User Research - Guerilla Testing<h2>
      <p>I chose to conduct my user research at the Malls and Coffeeshops due to
         these locals being a favorite daytime hangout for this particular
         demographic.</p>
    <h2>Competition and Market Analysis<h2>
      <p>The virtual reality market is projected to explode to 120 Billion Dollars
         by the year 2026. Most of the competitors were just a few start-ups.</p>
    <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>I decided to add a second user, The Gamer. After my initial interviews, it
         was discovered that grandparents entertainment spending habits are ,most
         of time, influenced by their grandkids (video gamers, in this case!).</p>
    <h2>Storyboard</h2>
      <p>A story of a grandfather who has no idea what to buy his grandson for his
         birthday.</p>
    <h2>1st iteration and User Feedback</h2>
      <p>After conducting user testing on a low-fidelity mockup using InVision,
         based on the feedback from both users types, re-designed the screens.
      </p>
    <h2>How Might We</h2>
      <p>I came up with 3 categories of how might we make the app easier to use,
         cost-effective and create demand.</p>
    <h2>User Flow - Happy Path</h2>
      <p>Final iteration was designed on Adobe XD, keeping in mind a smooth user
         flow experience. Always focusing on the user reaching the end and making
         that final purchase!</p>
